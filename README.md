Basic Shift Scheduler Created By Zangetsu 
Developed by Zion D. Kinniebrew-Jenkins

Overview

The Shift Scheduler Application is a mobile-friendly app designed to simplify shift scheduling tasks. The application allows users to:

Input and manage shift data (start and end times, lunch breaks, and additional breaks).

Dynamically calculate break times based on shift details.

Export the schedule data as a CSV file for external use.

This app is implemented using React Native to provide cross-platform compatibility for both Android and iOS devices.

Features

1. Dynamic Shift Management

Select shift start and end times using intuitive dropdown menus.

Automatically calculate the following based on input:

Lunch Break: 4 hours after the shift start.

First Break: 2 hours after the shift start.

Second Break: 1 hour before the shift ends.

Dispensing Shift: Starts 1 hour after lunch, but no earlier than 7:00 AM.

2. User-Friendly Interface

Clean, minimalistic design with responsive controls.

Uses RNPickerSelect for dropdown menus and FlatList for displaying data in a table-like format.

3. CSV Export Functionality

Uses the react-native-fs library to handle file creation and storage.
